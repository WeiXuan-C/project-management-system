# Rule: Write Meaningful Code Comments

When writing code comments, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Be descriptive**: Explain the "why" behind the code, not just the "what". The code itself shows what it does; comments should explain why it's done that way.

2. **Document complex logic**: Add comments to explain any complex algorithms or business logic that might be difficult to understand at first glance.

3. **Keep comments updated**: When code changes, make sure the comments remain accurate. Outdated comments are misleading.

4. **Use proper grammar and formatting**: Write in complete sentences with proper punctuation. Use consistent formatting for better readability.

5. **Comment public APIs**: Document parameters, return values, and exceptions for public methods and functions.

6. **Avoid redundant comments**: Don't add comments that merely repeat what the code clearly states.

7. **Use TODO, FIXME, and NOTE consistently**: These special comment markers should be used appropriately to mark areas needing future attention.

Remember: good comments explain "why" rather than "how". The code shows how; comments explain why the code exists and why it was implemented in a particular way.
